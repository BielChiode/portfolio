                • I developed an automation using Power Automate, Azure DevOps,
                and Microsoft Teams to automatically notify the owners of
                Features and User Stories whenever a new Issue is created and
                linked to them. This solution eliminated the need for manual
                tracking of child tasks, reduced developers' average response
                time by 45%, and improved real-time backlog traceability.
                <br />• Proactively introduced unit testing with Jest in a React
                Native application that previously had no test coverage,
                achieving ~30% coverage and strengthening code quality and
                stability.
